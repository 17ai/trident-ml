# Trident-ML
Trident-ML is a Trident library for distributed online machine learning.

It currently supports : 
* Linear classification (Perceptron, Passive-Aggresive, Winnow)
* Linear regression (Perceptron, Passive-Aggresive)

# TODO
* Implements Clustering (KMeans)
* Implements datastream pre-processing (normalization, standardization, sampling, ...)
* Implements feature extraction (NLP, Images, ...)
* Implements noise adaptive filter (LMS, Wiener, Kalman, ...)
* Implements nonlinear classification (Online Kernel trick, Online SVM, Online Decision Tree, ...)
* Implements detection change
