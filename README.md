# Trident-ML
Trident-ML aims to provide distributed online machine learning algorithms.

It currently supports : 
* Classification (Perceptron, Passive-Aggresive, Winnow)

# TODO
* Implements Clustering (KMeans)
* Implements Regression (Passive-Aggresive, Perceptron)
* Implements datastream pre-processing (normalization, standardization, sampling, ...)
* Implements feature extraction (NLP, Images, ...)
* Implements noise adaptive filter (LMS, Wiener, Kalman, ...)
* Implements nonlinear classification (Online Kernel trick, Online SVM, Online Decision Tree, ...)
* Implements detection change
